        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our project! We're implementing an Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that leverages the power of ensemble machine learning and blockchain technology.</p>
        <p>Our project addresses the limitations of traditional signature-based IDS by using advanced machine learning techniques to detect both known and unknown threats.</p>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>Our system's architecture combines machine learning and blockchain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensemble Machine Learning: We employ ensemble techniques like Random Forest, Bagging Ensemble, Boosting Ensemble, and voting mechanisms to build a robust IDS.</li>
            <li>Blockchain Technology: Blockchain enhances security, ensuring the integrity of our intrusion detection data. It's especially suited for IoT security applications.</li>

        <h2>Simulation and Working</h2>
        <p>We'll provide a brief overview of how our system simulates and works:</p>
        
        <h3>Test Network Setup</h3>
        <p>Before implementing our Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection System, we create a test network environment. This environment mimics real-world conditions and enables us to evaluate the system's performance and accuracy.</p>
        
        <h3>Machine Learning in Action</h3>
        <p>Our system utilizes ensemble machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, Bagging Ensemble, Boosting Ensemble, and voting mechanisms, to analyze network traffic and detect potential intrusions. Machine learning models process and analyze incoming data in real-time.</p>
        
        <h3>Blockchain Security</h3>
        <p>Blockchain technology is integrated to ensure the security and integrity of the intrusion detection data. All detected intrusion events are recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable and transparent ledger.</p>
        
        <h3>IoT Security Applications</h3>
        <p>Our system is particularly well-suited for securing Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It can safeguard connected devices and networks by detecting and responding to unauthorized access attempts and threats.</p>
